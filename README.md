# Coding-Assessment-Quiz
Timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions

## Description

- This project tests my ability to work with DOM manipulation and local storage.
- I was provided with two html files and styling
- I wrote and continually revised pseudocode laying out the logic, and kept console testing at every step
- This project helped me learn manipulation of data to an from local storage and converting between data types
- I learned about complications with addEventListener and preventing it from multiple firing with loops
